This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=368

dark colorscheme, pleasant, mainly blue and blueish-green,
based on Nightshimmer (vimscript #328) by Niklas Lindstr√∂m (http://vim.sourceforge.net/profile.php?user_id=577);

You'll find a screenshot at my place over here:

Thanks for voting this up, I'm surprised and delighted that you like this scheme as much as I do :-)
